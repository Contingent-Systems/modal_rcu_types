\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}
Our type system work builds on a great deal of related work on RCU implementations and models; and general concurrent program verification (via program logics, model checking, and type systems).

\mypar{Modeling RCU and Memory Models}
Alglave et al.~\cite{Alglave:2018:FSC:3173162.3177156} propose a memory model to be assumed by the platform-independent parts of the Linux kernel, regardless of the underlying hardware's memory model.
As part of this, they give the first formalization of what it means for an RCU implementation to be correct (previously this was difficult to state, as the guarantees in principle could vary by underlying CPU architecture). Essentially, that reader critical sections do not span grace periods. They prove by hand that the Linux kernel RCU implementation~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/AlglaveKT13,abssem} satisfies this property. According to the definition of \textsf{RCU} ~\cite{abssem,Alglave:2018:FSC:3173162.3177156}, our model in Section \ref{sec:semantics} is a valid RCU implementation (assuming sequential consistency):
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Grace-Period and Memory-Barrier Guarantee}: To reclaim a heap location, a mutator thread must synchronize with all of the reader threads with overlapping read-side critical sections to guarantee that none of the updates to the memory cause invalid memory accesses.
The operational semantics enforce a \textit{protocol} on the mutator thread's actions. First it unlinks a node from the data structure; the local type for that reference becomes \textsf{unlinked}. Then it waits for current reader threads to exit, after which the local type is \textsf{freeable}. Finally, it may safely reclaim the memory, after which the local type is \textsf{undef}.
The semantics prevent the writer from reclaiming too soon by adding the heap location to the free list of the state, which is checked dynamically by the actual free operation. We discuss the grace period and unlinking invariants in our system in Section \ref{sec:lemmas}.
\item \textit{Publish-Subscribe Guarantee}: Fresh heap nodes cannot be observed by the reader threads until they are published. As we see in the operational semantics, once a new heap location is allocated it can only be referenced by a local \textsf{fresh}. Once it is published, the local type for that reference becomes \textsf{rcuItr}; to put in other words, it is now safe for the reader thread to access it with local references in \textsf{rcuItr} type. We discuss the related type assertions for inserting/replacing(Figures \ref{fig:freshframeout}) a fresh node in Section \ref{subsection:type-rules} and the related invariants in Section \ref{sec:lemmas}.
\item \textit{RCU Primitives Guaranteed to Execute Unconditionally}: Uncoditional execution of RCU Primitives are provided by the definitions in our operational semantics for our RCU primitives(e.g. \lstinline|ReadBegin|, \lstinline|ReadEnd|, \lstinline|WriteBegin| and \lstinline|WriteEnd|) as their executions do not consider failure/retry.
\item \textit{Guaranteed Read-to-Write Upgrade}: Our system provides a clear separation of \textit{traverse-and-update} and \textit{traverse-only} intentions for \textsf{RCU} programming through the type system together(e.g. different iterator types and rules for the RCU Write/Read critical sections) with the programming primitives. 
  \end{itemize}
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first abstract \emph{operational} model for a Linux kernel-style RCU implementation -- others are implementation-specific~\cite{Mandrykin:2016:TDV:3001219.3001297} or axiomatic like Alglave et al.'s.

Tassarotti et al. model a well-known way of implementing RCU synchronization without hurting readers' performance, \textsf{Quiescent State Based Reclamation}(QSBR)~\cite{urcu_ieee} where synchronization in between the writer thread and reader threads provided via per-thread counters. Tassarotti et al.~\cite{verrcu} uses a protocol based program logic based on separation and ghost variables called \textsf{GPS}~\cite{Turon:2014:GNW:2660193.2660243} to verify user-level \textsf{RCU} singly linked list under \emph{release-acquire} semantics, which is a weaker memory model than sequential-consistency. They require \textit{release-writes} and \textit{acquire-reads} to the QSRB counters for proper synchronization in between the mutator and the reader threads. This protocol is exactly what we enforce over the logical observations of the mutator thread: from \textsf{unlinked} to \textsf{freeable}. Tassarotti et al.'s synchronization for linking/publishing a new node is also captured by our logical \textsf{fresh} observation. Based on these observations, we find it as an important future direction to investigate our type system formally with respect to these \textit{acquire-release} relations.

\mypar{Reusability of Predicates for Arbitrary Client Verification} We think that reusability of predicates used in arbitrary client verification is important. In this regard, Tassarotti et al.'s \textit{abstract-predicates} -- e.g. WriterSafe -- might not be easy to reuse for an arbitrary RCU client -- e.g. binary search tree -- as they include linked list specific logical constructions together with the constructions for QSRB model. Unlike, we use similar types both for BST(Appendix \ref{appendix:bst_del}) and linked-list based bag example.

\mypar{Program Logics} Fu et al.~\cite{shao_temp} extend Rely-Guarantee/Separation-Logic~\cite{vafeiadis07,Feng:2007:RCS:1762174.1762193,Feng:2009:LRR:1480881.1480922} with the \textit{past-tense} temporal operator to eliminate the need for using a history variable and lift the standard separation conjuction to assert over on execution histories. Gotsman et al.~\cite{Gotsman:2013:VCM:2450268.2450289} take assertions from temporal logic to separation logic~\cite{vafeiadis07} to capture the essence of epoch-based memory reclamation algorithms and have a simpler proof than what Fu et al. have~\cite{shao_temp} for Michael's non-blocking stack~\cite{Michael:2004:HPS:987524.987595} implementation under a sequentially consistent memory model.

\mypar{Realizing our RCU Model} A direct implementation of our semantics would yield unacceptable performance, since both entering(\lstinline|ReadBegin|) and exiting(\lstinline|ReadEnd|) modify shared data structures for the \textit{bounding-threads} and \textit{readers} sets. A slight variation on our semantics would use a bounding set  that tracked such a snapshot of counts, and a vector of per-thread counts in place of the reader set. Blocking grace period completion until the snapshot was strictly older than all current reader counts would be more clearly equivalent to these implementations. Our current semantics are simpler than this alternative, while also equivalent. We also know that if we had this slight variation in our model then all actions(traverse and read a heap value) from a reader thread would \textit{reduce} to a single \textit{atomic} action: read of a data value. However, we do not prove the \textit{atomicity} of the readers actions within the scope of this paper.

\mypar{Model Checking} Kokologiannakis et al.~\cite{Kokologiannakis:2017:SMC:3092282.3092287} use model-checking to test the core of \textsf{Tree RCU} in Linux kernel. Liang et al.~\cite{LiangMKM16} use model-checking to verify the \emph{grace period} guarantee of \textsf{Tree RCU}. Both focus on validating a particular RCU implementation, whereas we focus on verifying memory safety of clients independent of implementation. Desnoyers et al.~\cite{urcu_ieee} use the \textsf{SPIN} model checker to verify a user-mode implementation of RCU and this requires manual translation from C to SPIN modelling language.

\mypar{Type Systems}
Howard et al.~\cite{Howard:2011:RES:2001252.2001267,Cooper2015RelativisticPI} presents a \textsf{Haskell} library called \emph{Monadic RP} which provides types and relativistic programming constructs for write/read critical sections which enforce correct usage of relativistic programming pattern. They also have only checked a linked list. They claim  handling trees (look-up followed by update) as a future work~\cite{Howard:2011:RES:2001252.2001267}. Thus our work is the first type system for ensuring correct use of RCU primitives that is known to handle more complex structures than linked lists.
\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concls}
We presented the first type system that ensures code uses RCU memory management correctly, which is signifiantly simpler than full-blown verification logics. To this end, we gave the first general operational model for RCU-based memory management. Based on our suitable abstractions for RCU in the opoerational semantics we are the first showing that decoupling the \textit{memory-safety} proofs of RCU clients from the underlying reclamation model is possible. Meyer et al.~\cite{myr} took similar approach for decoupling the \textit{correctness} verification of the data structures from the underlying reclamation model under the assumption of the \textit{memory-safety} for the data structures. We demonstrated the applicability/reusability of our types on two examples: a linked-list based bag~\cite{McKenney2015SomeEO} and a binary search tree~\cite{Arbel:2014:CUR:2611462.2611471}. To our best knowledge, we are the first presenting the \textit{memory-safety} proof for a tree client of RCU. We managed to prove type soundness by embedding the type system into an abstract concurrent separation logic and encode many RCU properties as type-denotations and global invariants. By doing this, we did not need to prove these RCU invariants for each different client because we proved these properties once as a part of soundness proof.
