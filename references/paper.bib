A key challenge for concurrent programming is that side-effects (memory operations) in one thread can affect the behavior of another thread. In this paper, we present a type system to restrict the updates to memory to prevent these unintended side-effects. We provide a novel combination of immutable and unique (isolated) types that ensures safe parallelism (race freedom and deterministic execution). The type system includes support for polymorphism over type qualifiers, and can easily create cycles of immutable objects. Key to the system's flexibility is the ability to recover immutable or externally unique references after violating uniqueness without any explicit alias tracking. Our type system models a prototype extension to C# that is in active use by a Microsoft team. We describe their experiences building large systems with this extension. We prove the soundness of the type system by an embedding into a program logic.

We present a type system and inference algorithm for a rich subset of JavaScript equipped with objects, structural subtyping, prototype inheritance, and first-class methods. The type system supports abstract and recursive objects, and is expressive enough to accommodate several standard benchmarks with only minor workarounds. The invariants enforced by the types enable an ahead-of-time compiler to carry out optimizations typically beyond the reach of static compilers for dynamic languages. Unlike previous inference techniques for prototype inheritance, our algorithm uses a combination of lower and upper bound propagation to infer types and discover type errors in all code, including uninvoked functions. The inference is expressed in a simple constraint language, designed to leverage off-the-shelf fixed point solvers. We prove soundness for both the type system and inference algorithm. An experimental evaluation showed that the inference is powerful, handling the aforementioned benchmarks with no manual type annotation, and that the inferred types enable effective static compilation.

abstract="Optimistic concurrency algorithms provide good performance for parallel programs but they are extremely hard to reason about. Program logics such as concurrent separation logic and rely-guarantee reasoning can be used to verify these algorithms, but they make heavy uses of history variables which may obscure the high-level intuition underlying the design of these algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel program logic that uses invariants on history traces to reason about optimistic concurrency algorithms. We use past tense temporal operators in our assertions to specify execution histories. Our logic supports modular program specifications with history information by providing separation over both space (program states) and time. We verify Michael's non-blocking stack algorithm and show that the intuition behind such algorithm can be naturally captured using trace invariants.",
